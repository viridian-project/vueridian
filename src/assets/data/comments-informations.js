      "Yes, you are right to name these positive effects. But please keep in mind that we still support the big structures, the companies that avoid taxes, that lower the global farm gate prices as much as they can and that are responsible for a huge total climate impact. We could also say: those organic product lines are merely for show, to give them a nice fresh green paint. They are still made by the big bad ones and use their infrastructure and lobby power, and those companies don‘t aim for 100% organic, they just want to cater to the growing number of people caring for our planet, animals and people, because they see them as an interesting target group. Those products could even lessen the positiv effects of the organic movement, because they beat down the prices, they throw out the pioneer companies from the market and they give people a good conscience when they should be alarmed and look out for something better.<br>Therefore, my rating is: yes, better than their mainstream products, but still not good enough and made by the wrong ones!",

But this spread also contains a lot of ingredients which are transported around the globe: cocoa, coconut palm sugar, coconut oil, vanilla and maybe some more. This transportation is still fuelled by oil, so your rating is too optimistic. I suggest a more moderate rating.",
