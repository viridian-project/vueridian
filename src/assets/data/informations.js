        title: "Palm oil production is a massive climate killer",
        description:
          "To grow palm oil, vast areas of (often primordial) rainforest are destroyed to make place for plantations with 100% oil palm monocultures. To clear the land quickly, the forest is often burned down, releasing a lot of carbon dioxide and particulates affecting the health of the residents – sometimes even hundreds of kilometres away! Furthermore, the soil is very moist and contains a lot of peat, so it is drained before the plantations are set up. Peat is one of the most effective carbon dioxide stores, as long as it is wet. So, as soon as the forest is cleared and the plantationsa are established, the soil emits huge quantities of carbon dioxide. Indonesia and Malaysia are the two biggest growers and exporters of palm oil worldwide and the depicted practices are the reason why they, but especially Indonesia, rank very high in the list of the world‘s biggest CO<sub>2</sub>-emitters. Indonesia even made it to the top ten!<br><br>Besides this, the vast plantations also contribute massively to the degradation of forest, the reduction of biodiversity, is endangering the survival of vulnerable animal species such as orang utans, profits from land grabbing, expropriation of local communities, especially indigenous and traditional communities, makes use of forced labour and exploitation of migrant workers, especiall women.<br><br>Therefore, our current way to grow and produce palm oil is absolutely negative to nearly all categories that can be rated here, and since this spread contains a big amount of palm oil of very uncertain origin, we give this product a very negative rating. This company could do a lot better to produce a less harmful product!"

Therefore I really appreciate that there are more and more organic alternatives even by big mainstream companies, because they have a big influence on supermarkets and can reach out to a lot more people than smaller organic companies. Even though this product could be even much better – that‘s for sure – current studies show, that even the organic lines of big brands have a big positive effect due to their high quantities and visibility."

          "When it comes to fair trade, usually only products like coffee, cocoa, sugar and so on coming from the global south are concerned. But our in our industrialized agriculture and food market, also small producers from the north suffer from disadvantageous contracts, low prices and pressure from the multinationals. Therefore it is totally important, to expand the idea of fair trade to such producers, too. They also need reliable longlasting contracts, reasonable prices and market access. The dairy market is highly prone to the named problems. Willow organic food therefore uses only dairy products coming from fair production conditions."

          "I would like to emphasize that Willow is not just like any other organic foods company, they want to perfect what they do and they really mean it. Their energy consumtion in production has been cut half during the last five years and they completely rely on renewables which they produce themselves using solar panels on their rooftop and a combined heat and power station which is fuelled by their own firewood and bamboo harvest. They even implement circular resource chains oriented on the ideas of cradle to cradle. Their way to minimize the impact on our environment and especially the climate sets standards for our future ways of production. On top, their enterprise is employee-owned, so the profits don‘t go to some rich billionaires or multinational food giants, but to the people who work there, guaranteeing best working conditions."

Our livestock husbandry system not only torments millions of animals which are kept in captivity, it also produces a high proportion of greenhouse gases – directly and indirectly by the unsustainable production methods of animal food, especially soy beans from the amazonas region. So this product – since it is completely vegan – is much better that all the other non-vegan chocolate spreads on the market."
